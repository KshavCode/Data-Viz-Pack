# Data Visualisation And Analysis
A simple and beginner friendly project where you can learn data preprocessing, cleaning, visualization, etc. Using dataset from official sources, we aim to provide a detailed report on all the cases in a word file. Have fun reading all of them!

## Required Package(s)
Python Version Used: 3.11

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
```bash
pip install pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
```

## Installation Guide
Clone this repo and you can either read the 'Report.docx' of each case or just go through each python/jupyter file to understand how data has been processed and visualized to provide the report.

## Future Plans
Complete report and organising each case beautifully
